# Extra Credit
# For these next few exercises, you will have the exact same extra credit.

# Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.

# Read each one backwards or out loud to find your errors.

# From now on, when you make mistakes write down on a piece of paper what kind
# of mistake you made.

# When you go to the next exercise, look at the last mistakes you made and try
# not to make them in this new one.

# Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who
# like everyone to think they are perfect and never wrong, but it's all an act.
# They make mistakes all the time.
