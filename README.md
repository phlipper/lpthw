# Learn Python The Hard Way

I wrote some Python many years ago now, and now I'd like to revisit the language and try something new. [Zed's book](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) seemed like a good way to do that. Putting the code on Github seemed like a good way to "keep me honest".

This is probably of no use to anyone else, but feel free to look around.
